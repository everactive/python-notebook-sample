# python-notebook-sample

This repo contains a sample Python notebook that showcases how you can connect to the Everactive Data Services API, pull data generated by your Everactive ENV+ EvalKit, and visualize that data.

The notebook can be run locally with Docker or on the cloud in Google Colab.

Development is currently in progress, please check back soon.

In the meantime, check out our other client libraries and documentation on https://everactive.github.io/.
